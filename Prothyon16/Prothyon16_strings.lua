-- Story --
-----------
-- General overview:
--    As an experienced UEF commander you are invited into Prothyon-16 training facility for for demostration for new pilots.
--    Fighting AI in prepared scenarios. During the excercise Seraphim will launch an attack on the planet and your task
--    is to save sACU pilot surrounded on one of the island, evacuate civilians and yourself from the planet.
-- 
--
-- Pre-Seraphim Stage:
--
-- Mission 1
--    Starting with T1 ACU and only T1 tech your objective is to destroy 2 small bases.
--    Secondary objective to capture "Tech Centres" to unlock additional units and upgrades.
-- 
-- Mission 2
--    After successfully destroying first two bases map expands to south revealing new base which is fully T2
--    Main objective to defeat the AI again. Fighting against T2 land and air units this time.
--    Secondary objective to capture another "Tech Centres" to unlock additional units and upgrades.
-- 
-- Mission 3
--    Defeating AI which is on the island. Fighting against T2 air and naval.
--    When having most of the base destroyed, Seraphim will start an attack. Rest of the base is given to player.
-- 
-- Seraphim Stage:
-- 
-- Mission 4
--    Mission start with showing sACU pilot being under attakc of Seraphim, you objective is to save him.
--    In oder to do that, Seraphim ACU in the main base has to he killed and base destroyed.
--
--        TODO: This part might need to restructure and instead of main objective to kill island base, just kill those bases on the middle island
--              Since that will make more sence. Killing those will open route sACU to evacuate.
--              Then we need to make sure that the transport wont get shot down. Maybe objective to have certain amount of units near sACU base
--              in order for evacuation to behin.
--              
--    Secondary objectives to protect civilians and destroy all enemy bases on the island.                                                                                                           
--        Once seraphim bases are destroyed, evacuation of civilians starts
-- 
-- Mission 4 Part 2
-- 
--    If player takes too long, map expands and second Seraphim commander starts building base and attack playing. No objective on that.
--    After another (30min+-) Seraphim untis start spawning all around map. This is suppose to be game over. Attack needs to be strong enough to
--    player, eventually sACU which would lead to loss as well
-- 
--        TODO: Might not need the part with second Seraphim ACU at all. The mission is already long enough. Going straigh for units spawning everywhere.
--              Another thing to consider would be if sACU die, give objective to evac yourself anyway, since it kinda makes sense and after that
--              mark mission as lost?
