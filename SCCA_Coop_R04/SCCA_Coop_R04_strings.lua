Not only did the Aeon have complete access to QAI\'s data banks, they also managed to get into the central router and traced a number of messages. We can\'t be certain what they got, but it\'s a safe to assume that they at least know where a couple dozen Nodes are. We\'ve already sent warnings, but I don\'t know if that\'s enough. They also destroyed QAI\'s mainframe. We managed to salvage quite a bit, but QAI lost almost 39% of its memory. It\'ll be at least a year before QAI will be operating at 100% again.
